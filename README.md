# SapMachine Cloud Infrastructure

The SapMachine cloud infrastructure hosts Jenkins Master and Slave instances as well as the hosting of the SapMachine Linux Package server.
The [docker-compose configuration](compose.yml) describes a set of 7 Docker container.

1. **jwilder/nginx-proxy** (https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/): Starts a nginx reverse proxy and automatically redirects HTTP(S) requests based on the request URL to the corresponding Docker container. This routing is defined by the environment variable *VIRTUAL_HOST* of each Docker container.
2. **jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion** (https://hub.docker.com/r/jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion/): Automatically requests Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for the domains/subdomains which are used by the HTTPS server running in the Docker container:
	* sapmachine.io
	* ci.sapmachine.io
	* dist.sapmachine.io

3. [jenkins_master](ci/Dockerfile): The Jenkins Master instance
4. [dist_server](dist/Dockerfile): The Linux Package server
5. [redirect_server](redirect/Dockerfile): Redirects requests to sapmachine.io to the Sapmachine GitHup Page.
6. [ci_slave_ubuntu](ci-slave-ubuntu/Dockerfile): Jenkins Slave used for building Debian packages.
7. [ci_slave_alpine](ci-slave-alpine/Dockerfile): Jenkins Slave used for building Alpine packages.

The docker-compose configuration uses the [.env](.env) file for defining common environment variables.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Python 2.7 and pip

To install Python 2.7 and pip on Ubuntu, run:

```
sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pip
```

#### Ansible

Ansible 2.4 is requred to run the Ansible playbooks. In your shell, run the following commands:

```
git clone -b stable-2.4 https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
source ansible/hacking/env-setup
```

#### boto3

boto3 is an AWS plugin for Ansible.

```
pip install boto3
```

#### Keys for signing the Linux Packages

Place the public and private keys inside the [ci](ci) directory. It should have the following layout:

```
ci
 |
 keys
    |
    alpine
    |    |_ sapmachine@sap.com-5a673212.rsa
    |    |_ sapmachine@sap.com-5a673212.rsa.pub
    |
    debian
         |_ sapmachine.key
         |_ sapmachine.ownertrust
         |_ sapmachine.secret.key
```

#### Jenkins Credentials

Jenkins credentials will automatically be installed when the *credentials.yml* file is placed within the [ci](ci) directory.
The file contains two sections:

* **secret_text**: Specifices text secrets:
```
secret_text:
  -id: "MySecretText"
   description: "A secret text"
   text: "foo"
```
* **user_password**: Specifies User/Password logins:
```
user_password:
  - id: "MyLogin"
    description: "A login"
    user: "Foo"
    password: "Bar"
```

##### Example:

```
secret_text:
  - id: "SapMachine-Github-Token"
    description: "Access token of SapMachine github user"
    text: "12345678"
user_password:
  - id: "SapMachine-github"
    description: "User and password of SapMachine GitHub user"
    user: "SapMachine"
    password: "foobar"
  - id: "docker-sapmachine"
    description: "Docker account of SapMachine"
    user: "sapmachine"
    password: "foobar"
```

#### AWS Private Key

Place the *SapMachine.pem* private key file inside the [ansible](ansible) directory.

### Provision AWS Ressources

You need an [AWS access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in order to provision the AWS ressources.
Export the AWS access key:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="foo1234"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="12345abcd123"
```

Run the following command:

```
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts provision-aws.yml
```

### Setup the SapMachine master instance

Run the following command:

```
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-sapmachine.yml
```
